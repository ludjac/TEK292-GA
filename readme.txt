Hi Lars, 

Still alot of things to work on and improve. It was hard to stop working and
be satisfied. 

I have a very fast convergence for the top individual then it is hard to find
a new minimum. I would like to get out of this situation but i dont have the time
now. 

To run the algorithm just run the main.m file in MATLAB. Look through the code
to find parameters for different settings. An input for GA() called options
has some interesing aspects.
